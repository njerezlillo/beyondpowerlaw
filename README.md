This repository provides tools and methods developed in the study:

> [**Beyond the Power Law: Estimation, Goodness-of-Fit, and a Semiparametric Extension in Complex Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11200).  
*Jerez-Lillo N., Rodrigues F. A., Ferreira P. H., Ramos P. L.*  
arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.11200 

It includes functions for parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit testing, and a semiparametric extension incorporating change points. The repository is designed to facilitate the reproduction of results.

## Dependencies

This repository relies on two GitHub packages:

- [pldis](https://github.com/njerezlillo/pldis): Provides tools for estimating the scaling parameter and lower bound of the discrete power-law model using both frequentist and Bayesian methods.
- [pwpldis](https://github.com/njerezlillo/pwpldis): Implements the piecewise discrete power-law model, allowing for segmented power-law behavior.

## Repository Structure

### Scripts

- [altdistr.R](./altdistr.R): Implements probability mass functions and inverse transform sampling for alternative discrete models (Poisson, Exponential, Yule, Log-Normal). All models have been truncated to include a lower bound (see Clauset *et al.* 2009 for details). 
- [clauset.R](./clauset.R): Imports functions for fitting and evaluating the goodness-of-fit of the discrete power-law model using the methods of Clauset *et al.* (2009). Often referenced as "traditional methods". [(reference)](https://aaronclauset.github.io/powerlaws/)

### Applications

Located in the [application](./application) directory, these subfolders contain datasets and scripts used in the application section of the manuscript:

- [ICON](./application/icon) (Section 6.1):
